This chapter discusses statistical exchange-correlation in the self-consistent field. There are two sides to a self-consistent field calculation: the determination of the potential and the solution of Schrödinger's equation for the one-electron problem. The solution of Schrödinger's equation has fortunately advanced far enough through the application of the electronic digital computer so that it can be regarded for most purposes as being a standardized technique. The main point of the method of Gaspar, Kohn, and Sham is that they derive the approximate exchange correction from an approximate Hamiltonian for the system by varying the spin-orbitals to minimize the average value of this Hamiltonian for the ground state. The approximate Hamiltonian has many important and valuable features that are described in the chapter.}

title = {Comparing LDA-1/2, HSE03, HSE06 and G0W0 approaches for band gap calculations of alloys},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {It has long been known that the local density approximation and the generalized gradient approximation do not furnish reliable band gaps, and one needs to go beyond these approximations to reliably describe these properties. Among alternatives are the use of hybrid functionals (HSE03 and HSE06 being popular), the GW approximation or the recently proposed LDA-1/2 method. In this work, we compare rigorously the performance of these four methods in describing the band gaps of alloys, employing the generalized quasi-chemical approach to treat the disorder of the alloy and to obtain judiciously the band gap for the entire compositional range. Zincblende InGaAs and InGaN were chosen as prototypes due to their importance in optoelectronic applications. The comparison between these four approaches was guided both by the agreement between the predicted band gap and the experimental one, and by the demanded computational effort (time and memory). We observed that the HSE06 method provided the most accurate results (in comparison with experiments), whereas, surprisingly, the LDA-1/2 method gave the best compromise between accuracy and computational resources. Due to its low computational cost and good accuracy, we decided to double the supercell used to describe the alloys, and employing LDA-1/2 we observed that the bowing parameter changed remarkably, only agreeing with the measured one for the larger supercell, where LDA-1/2 plays an important role.}

The excitonic effects on optical spectra are included by solving the Bethe–Salpeter equation, considering quasiparticle eigenenergies and respective wavefunctions obtained within DFT-1/2 method. The electron–hole ladder diagrams are approximated by the screened exchange. To prove the capability of the procedure, we compare the calculated imaginary part of the dielectric functions of Si, Ge, GaAs, GaP, GaSb, InAs, InP, and InSb with experimental data. The energy position of the absorption peaks are correctly described. The good agreement with experimental results together with the very significant reduction of computational effort makes the procedure suitable on the investigation of optical spectra of more complex systems.}

We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VAMP (Vienna ab-initio molecular-dynamics package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semi-conducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable.}
