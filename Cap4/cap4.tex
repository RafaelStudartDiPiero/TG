This work presented an algorithm for graph exploration in a multi-agent system without communication, 
expanding on the solution proposed by \citen{Arthur2023}.
The flexibility provided by our framework,
which no longer relies on the open-source perfect maze generator by \citen{Naeem2021},
allows for expansion to various exploration policies and algorithmic variations.
Additionally, the modular design of our system enables integration of new exploration
strategies, paving the way for future advancements.

We conducted tests on 100 randomly generated 40x40 perfect mazes
and compared the results across three algorithms: 
our own, a backward interval variation, 
and an extended version of Tarry's algorithm. 
The results were validated against previous work \cite{Arthur2023},
confirming the correctness and reliability of our approach.

Looking forward, we aim to validate our algorithm
against established graph generation algorithms,
assessing its efficiency on a larger scale.
Exploring the implementation of more advanced algorithms
and optimizing the agents' decision-making processes will be essential
for enhancing the applicability of our approach.

By advancing multi-agent graph exploration without communication,
this research paves the way for innovations in autonomous systems,
with potential applications across various domains to be explored in future research.
