\section{Initial Results}
\label{section_result_initial_results}

This section presents our initial results,
aimed at replicating the findings from \citen{Arthur2023} to ensure the integrity of our implementation.
We tested our algorithm on 100 randomly generated 40x40 perfect mazes \cite{Naeem2021}, incrementing the number of agents from 1 to 40.
We evaluated:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Steps taken by the pioneer (first agent to find the goal).
    \item Fraction explored before the pioneer found the goal.
\end{itemize}

These tests were conducted for three implemented algorithms:

\begin{itemize}
\item Our Algorithm
\item Backward Interval Filling Variation
\item Extended Tarry's Algorithm \cite{Kivelevitch2010}
\end{itemize}

Below, we provide comparative visuals for each algorithm's performance.

Figures \ref{fig_comparison_steps} and \ref{fig_comparison_fraction} show a side-by-side comparison of our results with those from \citen{Arthur2023},
considering the default variation of the algorithm.

    \caption{Comparison of explored fraction: Left - Results from \citen{Arthur2023}; Right - Our results}
\label{fig_comparison_fraction}
\end{figure}

As evident from the figures, our results closely match the original findings,
demonstrating that our modifications have not altered the core functionality of the algorithm.

\section{Visualization Improvements}
\label{section_result_visualization}

Another significant improvement is the visualization capability for graphs.

To demonstrate this, we ran the algorithm on an imperfect maze, a cyclic graph, using three agents.
Below, we present the results: the overall exploration of the maze and the individual trees constructed by each agent.

\label{fig_agent_1_tree}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Cap3/agent_2.png}
\caption{Trees constructed by agent post-exploration: \textbf{Agent 2}.}
\label{fig_agent_2_tree}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Cap3/agent_3.png}
\caption{Trees constructed by agent post-exploration: \textbf{Agent 3}.}
\label{fig_agent_3_tree}
\end{figure}
    
These visualizations illustrate how each agent independently constructs its own representation of the graph,
adapting to the imperfections and resulting in different exploration paths.
